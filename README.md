# GoogleAppScript
This is an automation project where a PDF document is generated using Google Apps Script. The main objective of the project is to retrieve student information from a Google Sheets file and create a separate PDF file for each student. Each PDF contains the details of individual students, as recorded in the Google Sheets, including their personal and academic information. The process automates the extraction of data from the spreadsheet and converts it into a structured PDF document for each student, streamlining the task of generating and organizing student records.
